- - What does IIFL Bike insurance mean?
  - Two wheelers or bikes are the most convenient modes of transport these days. But, due to road conditions and rising traffic, it becomes necessary to protect your bikes from damages suffered in case of any unfortunate events. Having a two wheeler insurance helps cover you against any damage that may occur during a mishap like an accident, natural disaster or due to theft. A two-wheeler insurance policy also protects the financial liability which arises when the two-wheeler injures or kills any individual other than the owner of the vehicle. Moreover, if the two-wheeler damages any third party property, the policy also covers the financial loss incurred and payable by the policyholder. Also, carrying a two-wheeler insurance policy is mandatory as required by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
